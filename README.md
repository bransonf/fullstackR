# fullstackR
So you want to build a full-stack app in R?

### What is R?
R is a multipurpose programming language, similar to Python. R was developed originally for statistical analysis, but thanks to a growing community, it is now useful for everything from general purpose scripting to -- yes -- full stack application development.

### What is full-stack?
Full stack is a programming paradigm in which an application accepts user interaction (usually via a graphical interface) and communicates with a server in order to return a result to the user. The segment that deals with user interaction is generally referred to as the 'front-end' and the logic that process this input to return information is generally referred to as the 'back-end'.
