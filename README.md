# fullstackR
So you want to build a full-stack app in R?

### What is R?
R is a multipurpose programming language, similar to Python. R was developed originally for statistical analysis, but thanks to a growing community, it is now useful for everything from general purpose scripting to - yes - full stack application development.

### What is full-stack?
Full stack is a programming paradigm in which an application accepts user interaction (usually via a graphical interface) and communicates with a server in order to return a result to the user. The segment that deals with user interaction is generally referred to as the 'front-end' and the logic that process this input to return information is generally referred to as the 'back-end'.

## Preface
While it is possible to build full stack applications in R, it may not always be the right choice. Although some 
[companies are using R](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/companies-using-r), the R stack is among the least popular for full stack development. However, if you work in an environment where R is common (academia for example) and want to explore building applications, the R stack may be for you. It is also worth mentioning at this point that while you can build almost everything without leaving native R, you probably should not. R is incredibly capable with interfacing a variety of other languages (see Chapter 11) and doing so will greatly expand the capabilites of your application. Using SQL or other databases, for example, offers a more manageable and much quicker interface to large quantities of data.

### Other Languages
R offers the ability to interface a variety of other programming languages. Here, I will highlight some notable ones, and why you may want to integrate them with your application.

- Python
- C++
- JavaScript

Learning other languages has many other advantages as well. For example, JavaScript is currently in very high demand in the labor market.
